# Behavioral Mimicry Configuration
# ================================
# Human-like behavior simulation to bypass EDR behavioral ML detection
# Target: SentinelOne Behavioral Score = 0

# Mimicry Mode
# ------------
# disabled - No mimicry (fastest, highest risk)
# light    - Basic timing jitter only
# moderate - Mouse + keyboard simulation
# aggressive - Full human simulation
# paranoid - Maximum stealth, continuous activity (recommended)
# human    - Indistinguishable from real user (slowest)
mimicry_mode: paranoid
